# Mongo/Mongoose News Scraper
### *"All the News That's Fit to Scrape"*

My Mongo News Scraper app accomplishes the following:

Whenever a user visits my site, this app will scrape stories from The New York Times and display them. Each scraped article will be saved to my app's database. Users will be able to view the following information about the articles:

* Headline - the title of the article
* Summary - a short summary of the article
* URL - the url to the original article

Users will be able to comment on the articles and view their comments later. User comments will be saved to my app's database and will be associated with each article. Stored comments will be viewable for all users.

Please enjoy my Mongo News Scraper!
